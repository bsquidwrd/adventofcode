# adventofcode-2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023/

This is my first attempt at participating in the Advent of Code!
I'm super excited to see what it's about, and hope to learn Go alongside it!
I'm still super new to Go, so please don't think anything I do is best practice, I'm simply doing my best with the bits I know :D 

Run each advent like the following
```shell
cd ./src/day01
go run .
```
